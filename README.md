# Collaboration_JV_ebird_workflow

Welcome to GitHub repository of the CIJV and PBHJV !

This is a public space where we share the workflow and example R code pipelines used by  CIJV and PBHJV to analyse conservation data.  We hope other JV with similar objectives can use these examples for their conservation decision making. This is a work in progress and it is updated continuously.
